# E-Commerce-Product-Delivery-Prediction
The project aimed to predict whether an e-commerce product would be delivered on time while analyzing factors affecting delivery and customer behavior

## Conclusion
The aim of the project was to predict whether the product from an e-commerce company will reach on time or not. This project also analyzes various factors that affect the delivery of the product as well as studies the customer behavior. From the exploratory data analysis, I found that the product weight and cost has an impact on the product delivery. Where product that weighs between 2500 - 3500 grams and having cost less than 250 dollars had higher rate of being delivered on time. Most of the products were shipped from warehouse F though ship, so it is quite possible that warehouse F is close to a seaport. 

The customer's behaviour also help in predicting the timely delivery of the product. The more the customer calls, higher the chances the product delivery is delayed. Interestingly, the customers who have done more prior purchases have higher count of products delivered on time and this is the reason that they are purchasing again from the company. The products that have 0-10% discount have higher count of products delivered late, whereas products that have discount more than 10% have higher count of products delivered on time.
 
Coming to the machine learning models, the decision tree classifier as the highest accuracy among the other models, with accuracy of 69%. The random forest classifier and logistic regression had accuracy of 68% and 67% respectively. The K Nearest Neighbors had the lowest accuracy of 65%.
